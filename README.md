Company code features:
This application contains a company code feature that assigns all the employees within a company to that specific company. This allows the application to be used by multiple companies who can only view, access or modify data only within their own company. Newly registered users can only use the application after entering a company code generated by a manager. This allows the employee to be assigned to a specific company as well as provide more security to the users.
This makes the application a good choice for any small or large business looking for a professional time management application.
